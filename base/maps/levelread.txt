Name of Map -			dmcitadel
Full Name -			Citadelic
Created By -			Greg Barr
Title - 			Designer, Soldier of Fortune
Ideal Number of Players -	1 on 1, or 3-4 Free for All
Blurb -				A Dungeon themed level featuring a full loadout of offensive and defensive weapons with the exception of the Iron Doom. Neither the teleports or the shrines are random, this should allow players to learn the layout and predict/intercept opponents moves. Tricky jumps and sound cues are suited to 1 on 1 play rather than ffa but that doesn't exclude playing it for a quick bloodbath with more players.

Name of Map -			rendm
Full Name -			Blade Pit
Created By -			Mike Renner
Title - 			Designer, Heretic II
Ideal Number of Players -	4 for fast action; more for total carnage
Blurb -				Created with the Hive textures.  This is a big circular pit that tends to be a fast paced, fast action, high intensity map.  I wanted a staff only deathmatch with a twist.  I added the chicken hole to break up the action.  I made a staff only deathmatch for those who enjoy removing someone's limb and hunting them down.  If you cannot handle yourself with the blade staff, this would be a good place to learn.

Name of Map -			dmbloodfeud
Full Name -			Blood Feud
Created By -			Scott McNutt
Title - 			Designer, Soldier of Fortune
Ideal Number of Players -	6 to 8
Blurb -				Blood Feud is a dark and gloomy place to feed your slaughtering frenzies.

Name of Map -			DMLava
Full Name -			The Lava Palace
Created By -			Jeremy Statz (IRC: Terata)
Title -				Tomato gatherer, second circle, rank Journeyman
Ideal Number of players -  	5-12
Blurb:				This map is a port of a HexenWorld DM map I made a while ago, with a few areas added/changed and some secrets modified.  The lava is either nastier or easier to deal with, depending on who you ask, but it's still around.  Had to remove the secret room through the lava tunnel, unfortunately, because of the way H2's lava works.  Besides that, though, it converted pretty well and makes for a fun free-for-all DM.

Name of Map -			dmstonehenge	
Full Name -			<same>	
Created By -			Matt Pinkston	
Title - 			Designer, Heretic II	
Ideal Number of Players - 	6 or more
Blurb -				The Andoria tile set is what I chose for this particular level.  
There should be enough ups and downs, plenty of verticality, and lots of fun places for staff 
combat.  If you can’t figure out how to get the IronDoom, then start thinking like a chicken... 
bak bak bak.

Name of Map - 			dmoz
Full Name - 			Blood Orgy of the Damned
Created By - 			Mike "Oz" Schulenberg
Title -				Designer, Project 3
Number of Players - 		8 to 16
Blurb -				I wrought this cataclysmic bloodfest of hopeless despair using 
primarily the Dungeon texture set, supplementing it with other textures as necessary.  This map 
has plenty of weapons scattered about, including a Phoenix bow and an Iron Doom.  A large 
portion of it is rather symetrical, but it’s broken up with some other, unique areas.  I think 
it turned out pretty cool and I hope you do too.

Name of Map -			DMDarkness
Full Name -			Darkness
Created By -	 		Jeremy Statz (IRC: Terata)
Title -				Designer, Heretic II, Soldier of Fortune
Ideal Number of Players -  	2-6
Blurb -				This map is dark.  Like, really dark.  It started out as an 
experiment to see if I could keep everything in silhouette by lighting stuff in the distance, 
but nothing in the middle of rooms and such, but didn't really end up that way.  The darkness 
of it turned out pretty cool, though, as it kind of encourages you to be paranoid and sneak 
around a bit.  I put a water channel in the lower area, and a metal surface on the highest 
catwalk to allow good use of audio cues, also.  There are also a couple nice shortcuts should 
you be good at wall-flipping.

Name of Map -			dmtorture
Full Name -			Got Torture?
Created By -			Jon Zuk
Title - 			Lead Designer, Heretic II
Ideal Number of Players - 	6 or more
Blurb -				I created this level with the dungeon tile set.  This is a 
fairly straightforward deathmatch map with enough loops and over/under levels to keep people 
close to each other, and the action fast.  I didn't include the Iron Doom as I thought this map 
was too small for that weapon.  I made each room unique so you can quickly become familiar with 
the map.  Hope you enjoy it!

Name of Map - 			dmjersey
Full Name - 			Corridor of Chameleons
Created By - 			Jim Hughes
Title - 			Designer, Soldier of Fortune 
Ideal Number of Players - 	4 or more
Blurb -  			This is a small deathmatch map that was done using the Cloudhub 
Texture set.  There are 2 main atrium style rooms with lots of different height variations 
connected in various ways.  I tried to keep the vertical element strong in the map since it 
is fun to fire downwards at unsuspecting enemies.  Have fun.

Name of Map -			dmtower
Full Name -			Silverspring Tower
Created By -			Michael Raymond-Judy
Title -				Designer, Heretic II
Ideal Number of Players -	6 or more
Blurb -				This map was designed with a fairly large crowd in mind. There 
are only a couple of really good hiding places, only one really secret place, but there are 
lots of ways to escape when you’re low on health or ammo. Weapons and defensive spells are 
spread fairly evenly, but the "best" shrines are all on the outside main level - the rest of 
the shrines are random ones. While this is not technically a "king of the hill" map, the 
people who control the high ground (in this case the outside walks of the tower and the top 
area by the Phoenix Bow) have a tremendous advantage. It’s always good to be on top!
